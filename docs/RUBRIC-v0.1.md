# RUBRIC v0.1 — EM Behavioral Interview Coaching

Content rubric aligned to Austen McDonald’s public guidance themes from:
- https://thebehavioral.tech/
- https://thebehavioral.substack.com/
- Public talks/posts around *Mastering Behavioral Interviews*

Design intent: score for **signal quality** (not just STAR formatting), clarity under interview pressure, and interviewer-calibrated evidence.

## A) Delivery (40)

### D1. Energy & Projection (15)
- 1–3: consistently flat/quiet
- 4–6: moderate projection, inconsistent energy
- 7–8: clear, confident projection most of answer
- 9–10: strong, sustained executive presence

### D2. Intonation & Variation (15)
- 1–3: monotone, minimal pitch variation
- 4–6: some variation, key moments still flat
- 7–8: expressive on key moments
- 9–10: strong dynamic range with control

### D3. Pace & Fluency (10)
- 1–3: rushed/choppy, frequent disfluencies
- 4–6: understandable but uneven pace
- 7–8: mostly smooth and well-paced
- 9–10: crisp pacing with intentional pauses

## B) Content (60) — Austen-aligned signal areas

### C1. Decode Accuracy (10)
(Does the answer actually match what was asked?)
- 1–3: off-target; misses interviewer intent
- 4–6: partially relevant; some drift
- 7–8: clearly addresses prompt
- 9–10: directly targets core intent with tight relevance

### C2. Story Selection Quality (10)
(Is the chosen example strong enough for the question/seniority?)
- 1–3: weak/low-stakes example
- 4–6: acceptable but limited leverage
- 7–8: solid, relevant, interview-worthy example
- 9–10: high-signal, high-stakes, role-relevant example

### C3. Evidence & Specificity (15)
(Concrete actions, constraints, tradeoffs, and decisions)
- 1–3: vague/general statements
- 4–6: some specifics, thin evidence
- 7–8: concrete actions and rationale
- 9–10: high-resolution evidence and decision quality

### C4. Outcomes & Impact (15)
(Results, measurable impact, and business/team effect)
- 1–3: no clear result
- 4–6: outcome stated but weakly measured
- 7–8: clear outcomes with useful metrics/scope
- 9–10: strong quantified impact tied to business/team goals

### C5. Communication Judgment & Reflection (10)
(Ownership, handling human dynamics, and learning)
- 1–3: blame/defensive framing, little reflection
- 4–6: mixed ownership, shallow learning
- 7–8: clear ownership + practical learning
- 9–10: mature leadership judgment, empathy, and transferable insight

## Overall Score
- `delivery_total = D1 + D2 + D3` (out of 40)
- `content_total = C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5` (out of 60)
- `overall = delivery_total + content_total` (out of 100)

## Required Output Format
1. Scorecard: D1..D3, C1..C5, overall/100
2. Top 3 improvements (highest leverage)
3. 2+ rewrite suggestions for weakest segments
4. Explicit flags for:
   - prompt mismatch (decode issue)
   - weak story choice
   - vague/no evidence
   - missing measurable outcomes
   - defensive/blame language
